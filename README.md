# stats247-probability-with-computer-applications R PROGRAMING LANGUAGE HATE CLUB

I took sta247 and r programming language was used
if i had a burn book like regina george's i would add r to it.
so I'm just gonna play around with some of the concepts in python

dec 7:
bernoulli trials and discrete random variable probability models
finding out if i can pass a high school chemistry class (spoiler: i probably can't)
might also have a magic 8-ball tell me this
